Walk through each step of implementing an array. Don't rush through this by copying and pasting the code 
samples. Once you've walked through it and you understand the code of the Array class, hide the sample 
code and try writing the array class from scratch using the memory module here for allocating memory.

If you are using node, export the memory module and then import it using require. If you are using 
React, import the module using import*
